Honor pledge: mjlitz and kiweber have neither given nor received aid
on this assignment.

In general we took the approach of prioritizing points. As such,
the goheels() command was the first thing finished. After that, 
we more or less went in order. Most components were completed primarily 
by just one of the partners, with some input from the other.
The exception to this was part one, started by Isaac and finished by Matt.

We attempted to do the time extra credit, but we were unable to get the
finer details down.

We realized relatively early on that it made sense to share a single
folder in classroom, which led to some slight confusion, but ultimately
to excellent version control. We also discovered, as a by-product of 
this, that not everyone's envp array is ordered the same. Much code was
re-written to call from getenv() rather than pulling strings out of the 
envp array.

Logistics:
The only files included in the assignments are this README, thsh.c,
and thsh. We are using 7.5 late hours on this, for a total of 18.5 used. 
Hopefully, we have also learned our lesson about starting late.
