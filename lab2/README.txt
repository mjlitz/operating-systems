Honor pledge: mjlitz and kiweber have neither given nor received aid
on this assignment.

Approach
We completed exercises 1-4, and none of the challenges yet. Our approach was pretty simple. We commented the code of the skeleton to understand it more thoroughly, then writing out the function of member of the structures, and drew diagrams on paper to see how they related to each other. This step seemed very useful in our ability to complete the lab quicker.
Version control was not a big issue, as there were not as many changes, and we updated more quickly.
We separately worked on different exercises - Isaac worked on exercise 1, and Matt worked on exercise 2 simultaneously, etc.

Skeleton Modifications
We had some very slight skeleton modifications, including adding bytes_per_object and max_objects to the bookkeeping struct. Most other skeleton modifications were style based, or to make the code look more clean.

Testing
Isaac mainly had the approach of using many different test cases to test the overall output of malloc and free, and Matt mainly had the approach of inspecting pointers, addresses, and variable counts in gdb. 
This dual approach seemed to work pretty well, and I'm fairly confident we caught almost all bugs. This time we spent a lot more time on testing, so we are more confident with the product we're turning in.

Files included:

Directories:
tests/ --> this is where the .c files for the tests live
tests_exe/ --> exe files for the tests. Makefile handles all this.
